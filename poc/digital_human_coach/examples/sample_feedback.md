2. **Eye contact exercise** - Record yourself and consciously look at the camera every 5-7 seconds
3. **Script key transitions** - Pre-plan connecting phrases to avoid filler words at transitions
4. **Gesture practice** - Record and review to identify jerky movements; practice smoother transitions

### Detailed Analysis

Your presentation demonstrates solid fundamentals with clear room for refinement. The content is well-structured, and your natural speaking pace keeps the audience engaged. Your posture and body language convey confidence, which is excellent.

The primary areas to focus on are eliminating filler words and improving eye contact consistency. Filler words, while not excessive, interrupt your otherwise smooth delivery. Practice recording yourself and consciously replacing fillers with brief pauses—this will make you sound more authoritative.

Your eye contact shows room for improvement. While you do engage with the camera, the consistency could be better. Think of the camera as a person you're talking to, and make regular, natural eye contact.

Your gestures are generally effective but occasionally appear abrupt. This is common and easily fixable with practice. Record yourself and watch for transitions between gestures—aim for fluid movements rather than sudden starts and stops.

Overall, you have strong foundational skills. With focused practice on these specific areas, you can move from a 7.5 to a 9+ rating within a few weeks.
