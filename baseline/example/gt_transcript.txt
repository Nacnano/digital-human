Good evening, everyone,

Thank you for being here today. We live in a time of rapid change, and with change comes both challenge and opportunity. What matters most is how we respond. If we face these moments with courage, kindness, and unity, we will not only endure but thrive.

Let us work together, support one another, and believe in the future we can build. Together, our strength is limitless.

Thank you.
